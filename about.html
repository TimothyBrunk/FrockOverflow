        <h1>FrockOverflow</h1>
        <h2>A Question & Answer forum </h2>
        <p>FrockOverflow is a collaborative project built by Timothy Brunk, Brenton Gumucio, and Sarah Lobser 
        in their ninth week at Skill Distillery, full stack Java developer bootcamp. The concept of FrockOverflow 
        is largely borrowed from the wildly popular StackOverflow. The vision was to have a forum for Skill Distillery 
        students to post and answer eachother's urgent coding questions </p>
        <h3>Technologies used</h3>
        <p>The FrockOverflow project integrates the Hibernate implementations of the Java Persistence API with 
        the SpringMVC framework, allowing users to persist posts in a SQL database deployed on Amazon Web Services.</p>
