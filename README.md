The first team project assigned to us; this project began at the end of quarter 2 and incorporated Java,
 SQL and JPA. Our 3 person team decided to build a question and answer forum similar to StackOverflow. 
 Since our school director's name is Cole Frock the name of the project was obvious. We had 8 days build 
 this project from idea to full implementation.
